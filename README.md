# toy-model
This is a hybrid model of the global ocean with simplified governing equations to understand large scale circulations.

UPDATE: We have shifted our work to a more complete [repository](https://github.com/ClimateFluidPhysics-ANU/MixedLayerThermoclineDynamics.jl) that contains tests each time we push our work. Furthermore, we've shifted to Julia, owing to its many advantages like multiple dispatch, etc.
